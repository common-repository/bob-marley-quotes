Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 2.7
Stable tag: 1.1

== Description ==

 This is a plug-in based on the Hello Dolly plug-in that comes as a default with Wordpress. I liked the idea of that so much, I figured that the inspiring words of Bob Marley would be a cool alternative. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from Bob Marley's archive in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `marley_quotes.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Notes ==
Since the Wordpress people released version 2.7, and changed the whole look of the dashboard, this thing needed to be changed a bit. This version 1.1, should be used for anyone running wordpress 2.7 or newer. Hope someone out there will enjoy this :)
